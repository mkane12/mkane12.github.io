<p>I am a member of the Social Branding team (Public Relations and Media Correspondence) of art collective teamLab - an international group of interdisciplinary artists and programmers who create immersive exhibitions around the world. In my current role, I am responsible for media outreach in both Japanese and English to secure coverage of teamLab in the form of video, journalistic articles, and social media postings. I arrange shoots and interviews for such coverage and ensure their quality and accuracy before publication. I am also responsible for the coordination of collateral for given exhibitions, including signage, posters, websites, etc.</p>

<p>At Harvard, my time was split between my academic pursuits in Statistics and East Asian Studies, my summer activities abroad in Japan, and my leadership role with the Harvard Radcliffe Gilbert & Sullivan Players (HRG&SP), a student-run theatre group on campus.</p>

<p>My studies focused on data analysis and visualization, the utilization of data to tell a comprehensive story and come up with solutions to given problems. I also spent time as an undergraduate researcher with Harvard's Institute of Quantitative Social Sciences (IQSS), writing vignettes and testing packages in R related to text parsing and analysis.</p>

<p>Outside of the classroom, I was a Board member of HRG&SP, responsible for the biannual production of theatrical operettas from the works of W.S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan. My role as a board member and frequent producer and light designer gave me a great deal of experience in leadership and coordination, as well as more technical theater-related skills.</p>

<p>My summers were spent in Japan, becoming proficient in the language and gaining international work experience, both in and outside of technical fields. These experiences afforded me a deeper understanding and love of Japanese culture and life in Japan, and allowed me to better understand relations between Japan and the US.</p>
