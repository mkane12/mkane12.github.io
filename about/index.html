  	<p>Hello! My name is Michaela, and I'm a current Junior at Harvard University majoring in Statistics with a minor in East Asian Studies. 
	My areas of interest include data analysis, web design, and data visualization. I am also a huge fan of all things Japanese - 
	culture, food, media, you name it - so I hope to work in Japan both this summer and after graduation, at least for a time. </p>
