  <p>As I said earlier, I'm a current Junior at Harvard University majoring in Statistics with a minor in East Asian Studies. My areas of
  interest include data analysis, web design, and data visualization. I am also a huge fan of all things Japanese - culture, food, media,
  you name it - so I hope to work in Japan both this summer and after graduation, at least for a time. </p>
